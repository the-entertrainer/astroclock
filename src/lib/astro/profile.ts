    'You start before the committee finishes talking. People read you as direct, warm under pressure, and impatient with vague plans. When nothing needs doing, restlessness shows — channel it into one clear next step instead of picking fights with the silence.',
  Vrishabha:
    'You build trust slowly and keep what you value. Others notice calm loyalty and a good sense for comfort; you are not quick to pivot. Once you commit, follow through — and say no early when a change would scrap something you still care about.',
  Mithuna:
    'You collect people, routes, and ideas. Conversation is how you think, and boredom hits harder than hard work. Finish one thread before opening three more, or you leave people unsure what you meant.',
  Karka:
    'Belonging matters more than applause. You read rooms through feeling, and you protect your people. When home feels safe you are generous; when it does not, you pull back — name what would restore trust instead of going silent.',
  Simha:
    'Being overlooked feels personal. You lead with creative warmth and want your effort noticed. Ask for clear feedback in private, put your name on work you care about, and do not bet your whole mood on applause.',
  Kanya:
    'Mess and vagueness bother you. You help through competence, and quiet precision is how you show care. Soften critique with one kind line, and pick one useful fix instead of rewriting the whole system.',
  Tula:
    'You weigh options and keep the peace. Unfairness lands in your body before you argue. Name your preference before you negotiate, and do not swallow discord just to keep the room pretty.',
  Vrischika:
    'You go deep or not at all. Trust is earned, not assumed, and half-measures frustrate you. Ask for honesty early, and put intensity into one loyal project instead of testing everyone.',
  Dhanu:
    'You aim past the near field — meaning, humour, and a wider horizon keep you kind. Petty loops make you irritable. Book learning or travel that widens the frame, and leave one small duty finished so freedom does not become avoidance.',
  Makara:
    'You earn respect by finishing hard things over time. You do not trust flashy talk; reliability outranks charm. Let results speak, schedule rest so the climb is not a cage, and soften after respect is already clear.',
  Kumbha:
    'You bond through ideas, odd allies, and future plans more than traditional romance theatre. Detachment can be a shield. Pick one group or cause to show up for regularly so belonging has a real address.',

  Kanya:
    'You sort feelings into categories. Care shows as usefulness and quiet critique more than melodrama. Chaos in someone’s habits frays the bond — offer one practical repair instead of a storm of fixes.',
  Tula:
    'Harmony-seeking runs deep; relational weather often dictates inner weather. Beauty and fairness are emotional medicine. Name unfairness early, and state one preference before you smooth everything over.',
  Vrischika:
    'Feelings are all-or-nothing — loyalty, jealousy, deep resets. Surface calm may hide undertow. Choose honesty over half-open doors, and give trust time instead of testing people.',
  Dhanu:
    'Mood expands toward meaning. Boredom or dogma collapses the emotional sky. Keep a horizon (belief, travel, teaching, humour that widens the frame), and exit one petty loop on purpose.',
  Makara:
    'Affect is reserved and durable. Safety is earned through competence and time, not instant confession. Show commitment as endurance, schedule softness so you do not bottle feelings until they land heavy.',
  Kumbha:
    'Care can feel friendship-toned. You may feel odd in private and lucid in groups. Seek egalitarian bonds and quirky needs openly — possessive romance usually backfires.',

  Rohini: 'Once fascinated, you grow and attract around a chosen target — pick one, then feed it daily.',
  Mrigashira: 'You hunt options; stillness is rare until the trail is sniffed — shortlist two choices and decide by tonight.',
  Ardra: 'Insight often arrives after a storm — tear down what is broken, then rebuild one piece before the next critique.',

  Pushya: 'You nourish on schedule; care and timing steady the mind — keep meal, rest, and check-in times sacred.',
  Ashlesha: 'You read undercurrents; keep ethics tight in intimacy — ask before you dig, and do not use secrets as leverage.',
